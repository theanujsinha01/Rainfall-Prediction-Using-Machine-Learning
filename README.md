# Rainfall-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts whether it will rain or not based on weather features like pressure, humidity, dew point, cloud cover, sunshine, wind direction, and wind speed.  We use a Random Forest Classifier, a popular ML algorithm, trained on historical weather data. The model learns patterns and helps us forecast rain chances.
